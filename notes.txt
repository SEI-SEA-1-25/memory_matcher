- when every card is face-up, you win
- we need a lose condition: either x number of turns have been played, or x amount of time has gone by, etc
- track how many turns have been played, or how long the game has been going
- animation: classList.add to give it a class that makes it rotate



state to track:
  - how many turns have been played
  - how many cards have been flipped (so we don't go beyond 2)
  - which cards have been flipped in this round
  - which cards have been matched successfully
  - list of all face down card values
